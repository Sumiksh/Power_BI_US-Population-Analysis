US Population Power BI Dashboard Report
Population Data by Region:
The report offers a high-level view of the population distribution across the U.S. divided into four regions: South, West, Midwest, Northeast
The population is visualized on a bar chart for a quick comparison between these regions.

Population Over Time (Year-wise):
The report also includes a time-series analysis showing the population changes from 1970 to 2022. The graph provides a clear view of population growth over the years, allowing users to identify trends, such as significant population increases or decreases across specific periods.

Geography Layers on Azure Maps:
The integration with Azure Maps allows for interactive geographic mapping. Users can hover over and click on different states or regions to get more granular population information. This map uses OSM (OpenStreetMap) data and TomTom layers to display the geographical regions.

Filters:
Year Filter: The report allows users to filter population data for specific years, including all years between 1970 and 2022.
Geography Filters: Users can filter the data based on region, state, or metro area. These filters help drill down into specific population data at different levels of geographic granularity.
Reset Filters: There is a feature for clearing all filters, ensuring users can start over with fresh parameters.

Clear Slicer Options:
Users can click on the "Clear all slicers" option to reset the filters to their default state, allowing for a fresh view of the data without any pre-applied filters.

Interactive Charts and Visualizations:
The report utilizes grayscale light tones for better visualization and clarity. The population is represented on a visual scale to easily compare the size of each region and state.

Drill-Down Capabilities:
Clicking on a region (South, West, etc.) will show the population data for each state in that region.
Further drilling down will reveal detailed population information at the county or metro area level, allowing for more localized insights.
